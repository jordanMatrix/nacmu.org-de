      <h3>New Horizon Sponsorship Program</h3>
      <p>
        For many families who live hand-to-mouth from the land in the villages around Noah's Ark, the chances they can pay for their children to go to school are next to nothing. Many of the families are illiterate and have little hope of substantially changing their lives.

      <p>
	      Typically, the father is absent and the mother moves from job to job in distant villages so care for these children comes down to grandparents. Most of these caretakers grow vegetables is a small garden to sell at the market and more often than not, this income is not enough even for basic needs.  <p>We believe that education is the key to breaking this cycle of poverty and believe education will give them a New Horizon.  Together with a parents committee, Noah's Ark identifies the neediest families in the surrounding villages and offer them a scholarship to attend school.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        <strong>
          You can help a child go to school for as little as $40 a month
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a sponsor, you will receive an update two or three times reporting your sponsored child's academic progress, a photo plus a personal message or drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can be sure your sponsorship is used for what it is intended because missionaries, volunteers and the founders raise their own support through other channels.

              <p>
                Zion is a happy though shy girl who, lives with her sister and mother. The family separated from their father after their father deserted their mother for not giving birth to a boy; she discovered that he had gone ahead and got another wife and children; so decided to concentrate on her girls by continuing to make and sell doughnuts and plant crops in her small garden by the side of her home. She was very grateful for Zion to join New Horizon Nursery in Baby Class; she said, at least her daughter will be able to get a good education and better future.
Zion enjoys reading story books, looking at different pictures in the story books and doing class work which the teacher says she does with all her heart.

                <strong>Joanita</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Joanita is a 5 year old girl who is the youngest in a family of five siblings. Joanita lives with her sick mother who had a swollen stomach; her father looked after her for a year and a half but he decided to move on and get another wife.
This took a toll on the family because the father was the breadwinner of the home. He informed the family that he does not want anything to do with them, so the mother decided to put a small vegetable stall at her door step to feed her family.
Joanita joined New horizon in Baby Class and loves reading story books and colouring.

              <p>
                Keffa has 2 older siblings. His parents are separated and he doesn’t receive any support  from his father. His father completely disconnected himself from his mother and him. 
Keffa’s mother is not in good health and is unable to do much for her children, she was advised by the doctor not to indulge herself in any heavy duties that will be a threat to her health. The only thing she does now is a samosa business thus she fries and sells them to earn a living. What she earns is not enough to sustain her with the children.

              <p>
                
David is a sweet boy who, has learnt to come out of his shell and gained more confidence especially when playing with his peers. He was born in August 2011 in a village near Noah’s Ark called Takajjuge. He lives with his two siblings and his father who is works as a guard at a nearby school. David’s mother passed away recently; at that time she was washing clothes. Immediately after her passing on, his father took on the role of taking care of them and providing for all their basic needs despite the challenge of having less income.
David joined New Horizon in baby class and has now graduated to Primary One. He loves singing and counting numbers that hang on the classroom wall.

                Ryan has hydrocephalus and he is a slower learner.  His mother sells paraffin in the evening and during the day grows small mushrooms to sell. Ryan’s father wants nothing to do with him and does not believe he needs to support a child with disabilities. He chased Ryan, his mother and his 2 siblings out of the house. Ryan’s mother is a member of an organisation that helps families of children with Spinal Bifida and hydrocephalus, the organisation forced the father to build a house for his mother and siblings. He supported them for a little while but soon disappeared without a trace.  Ryans mother is supporting her three children and needs lots of support. Ryan also takes expensive medication, so there is no money left over to pay for Ryans education.              </p>
